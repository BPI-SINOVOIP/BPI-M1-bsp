This document provides setup instructions for setting up and testing bluetooth on
a Fedora Core 9 system.

Setting up Fedora Core 9
========================

You can try to install FC9 via a DVD onto a hard-drive based system or
create a liveUSB disk (if you use the same PC for testing other versions of
linux).


Install to HD from DVD install:

   You can install FC9 from here:  http://fedoraproject.org/get-fedora


Install FC9-liveCD to USB disk (create a liveUSB):

   **** MAKE SURE YOUR PC CAN BOOT TO USB DISKS, older PCs may not support this in their BIOS ******

   A 4GB USB drive will be sufficient although 8GB is recommended.

   **** Limitations:
         Using LiveUSB has some limitations:
             1. USB flash drives have limited writes (typically 100,000).  The swap partition is disabled on
                a liveUSB.  If you expect to do local compilation and editing you should use a hardisk install
                or use a USB-based harddisk (laptop drive size would be okay).
             2. USB HD access is slower than USB disk.  But I have not noticed any terrible slowdowns.

   *** If your USB disk has U3 support (Sandisk Cruzer), you must disable it.  The disk contains a utility to disable
   U3 support.  As an added check, you should also re-format the drive (as FAT) after your disable U3.

   Making FAT-based USB image on Windows Host PC :
   ===============================================

   A windowsPC Utility is available to install a liveCD ISO image directly onto a USB disk and make the disk
   bootable. See: https://fedorahosted.org/liveusb-creator

   This method requires a liveCD ISO file for FC9.  FC9 is the current version that
   support LiveUSB's persistent data storage.  You can install applications, new tools, SDKs etc..

   You can find the FC9 liveCD here:

            http://fedoraproject.org/get-fedora

   When using the utility, you can setup a persistent area.  I recommend at least 2GB (max).

   *********** WARNING WARNING, FAT16 is unreliable and not recommended as a liveUSB boot
   disk.  Newer version of the liveusb-creator now support installations and syslinux binaries for
   EXT2 filesystems.  I highly recommend using a liveUSB image on an EXT2 formated USB drive.

   Making Ext2-based USB image on Linux Host (for use on FC9 or later host) :
   ============================================================================

   Get the liveCD ISO image from http://fedoraproject.org/get-fedora

   Install the liveusb-creator utilities (as super user) :

       > yum install liveusb-creator
       > yum --enablerepo=rawhide update syslinux

   Partition USB disk:

       > fdisk /dev/<usb disk e.g. sdb>

		<--------- fdisk interactive dump: ---->
		Command (m for help): d
		Selected partition 1

		Command (m for help): n
		Command action
		e   extended
		p   primary partition (1-4)
		p
		Partition number (1-4): 1
		First cylinder (1-960, default 1):
		Using default value 1
		Last cylinder or +size or +sizeM or +sizeK (1-960, default 960):
		Using default value 960

		Command (m for help): t
		Selected partition 1
		Hex code (type L to list codes): 83

		Command (m for help): a
		Partition number (1-4): 1

		Command (m for help): w
		The partition table has been altered!

		<----------------------------------------->

	Format partition as ext2:

        > umount /dev/<usb disk e.g. sdb1>
        > mkfs.ext2 /dev/<usb disk>

    Run liveusb-creator GUI application:

        > liveusb-creator

    Select ISO image, kernel type (FC9-i686) and persistent storage size.

        see : https://fedorahosted.org/liveusb-creator



Checking and installing packages:
=================================

To compile our SDK, certain development packages must be installed.

Log in as superuser

execute the following:

   yum install yum-utils rpmdevtools
   yum install kernel-devel
   yum install gtk2-devel
   yum install dbus-glib-devel
   yum install bluez-utils-gstreamer
   yum install openssl-devel
   yum install libpcap-devel
   yum install bluez-libs-devel
   yum install alsa-lib-devel
   yum install dbus-devel

Some useful utilities:

   yum install telnet-server
   yum install iperf

For compilation of newer BlueZ utilities and BlueZ stack:

   yum install byacc
   yum install flex
   yum install bison


Setting up and BUILDING OLCA
=============================

1. Export ATH_BUILD_TYPE=LOCAL_FC9_i686
   Export ATH_BUS_TYPE=SDIO

   The default kernel path is set to:

       ATH_LINUXPATH=/lib/modules/2.6.25-14.fc9.i686/build

2. Set your WORKAREA and build normally.


Testing AR6K
============

1. Unload sdhci (MMC-stack standard host driver)

   as root, execute  "rmmod sdhci"

2. Set NETIF, WORKAREA, ATH_PLATFORM variables and execute the load script (same procedure as FC3).
